# BeeCom

BeeCOM is a lightweight, efficient, and easy-to-use C++ library designed for communication in embedded systems. It provides a comprehensive solution for packet-based communication, including packet serialization/deserialization, CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) validation, and customizable transport mechanisms. This library is particularly suited for applications requiring reliable data exchange over serial interfaces or custom communication protocols.

## Key Features

- **Packet-Based Communication:** Structure your data into packets for organized and reliable transmission.
- **CRC Validation:** Ensure data integrity with CRC checks, utilizing a customizable CRC calculation function.
- **Serialization and Deserialization:** Automatically convert between packets and byte arrays for transmission and reception.
- **Customizable Transport Layer:** Define your own byte receive and transmit functions to integrate with any physical layer protocol.
